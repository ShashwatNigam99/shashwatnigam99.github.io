I am a recent CS graduate from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank" >International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H)</a>. I will be joining Goldman Sachs as an analyst in July 2021, in the Global Markets division.

I have been pursuing my honors research under <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ" target="_blank" >Dr. Madhav Krishna</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=oLJTcXIAAAAJ" target="_blank">Dr. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla</a> at the <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank" >Robotics Research Center (RRC, IIIT Hyderabad)</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank" > Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad)</a>. My work has mainly focused on Monocular 3D Reconstruction and Layout Estimation for performing Robotic Perception tasks, 3D Synthetic Data Generation and Simulation to Real Transfer.

I have also been involved in a research project with a diverse team from <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" >Stanford</a>, <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/" target="_blank"> Polytechnic University of Milan</a> and <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en" target="_blank">KAUST</a> where we are exploring applications at the intersection of Geometric Deep Learning and Architecture. I had the pleasure of working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tonoalberto" target="_blank"> Alberto Tono</a> and being advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHW7n4kAAAAJ" target="_blank">Dr. Cecilia Bolognesi</a> and <a href="http://dmichels.de/" target="_blank"> Dr. Dominik Michels</a>.

Interested in machine learning, deep learning with a special focus on computer vision. Experience with finance and quantitative analysis. Currently exploring blockchain and cryptocurrencies!

Do hit me up if there is something we can discuss!
