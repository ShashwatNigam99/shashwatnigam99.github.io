I am a Master's in Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning. Currently, I am a teaching assistant for <a href="https://dellaert.github.io/22F-3630/" target="_blank">CS3630: Introduction to Robotics and Perception</a> under <a href="https://dellaert.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Dellaert</a> . Prior to this, I worked as an quant strat in the Systematic Trading Strategies Team, Global Markets Division at Goldman Sachs, Bangalore.

I pursued my honors research under <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=QDuPGHwAAAAJ" target="_blank" >Dr. Madhav Krishna</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=oLJTcXIAAAAJ" target="_blank">Dr. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla</a> at the <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank" >Robotics Research Center (RRC, IIIT Hyderabad)</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/" target="_blank" > Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad)</a>. My work mainly focused on Monocular 3D Reconstruction and Layout Estimation for performing Robotic Perception tasks, 3D Synthetic Data Generation and Simulation to Real Transfer.

I was also involved in a research project with a diverse team from <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" >Stanford</a>, <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/" target="_blank"> Polytechnic University of Milan</a> and <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en" target="_blank">KAUST</a> where we explored applications at the intersection of Geometric Deep Learning and Architecture. I had the pleasure of working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tonoalberto" target="_blank"> Alberto Tono</a> and being advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHW7n4kAAAAJ" target="_blank">Dr. Cecilia Bolognesi</a>.

I interned at Goldman Sachs over the summer of 2020 where I was introduced to Finance and Quantitative Trading. Following this, I was a trainee at <a href="https://www.oaktreeandlion.com/" target="_blank">Oaktree & Lion</a> where I studied and analyzed cryptocurrency derivatives trading strategies under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/conradcarvalho/" target="_blank"> Conrad Carvalho</a>.

I have been exploring blockchain and cryptocurrencies in my free time. My team was runner's up at the <a href="https://worldblockchainhackathon.com/" target="_blank"> World Blockchain Hackathon</a>, for our idea <a href="https://github.com/adhithyaarun/skill-wallet" target="_blank"> SkillWallet</a>.

Do hit me up if there is something we can discuss!
